%There are 369 (nodes) stations in the edge data,
%/london_tube_edges.txt
%
% labelled from 0 to 368.
% But only 271 stations have corresponding 
% passenger data---these are for the undergound 
% train lines.
%
% These 271 stations appear in the passenger usage list at
%/london_tube_usage.txt
%

Edges = load('cropped_edges.txt');
%%% First row of Edges is [4     1    77     1]
% 4 is id of the transport line 
% (we need this to be between 1 and 11)
% edge is from node 1 to node 77
% weight is 1 (as for all edges here)

% Create adjacency matrix 
% We know that there are 369 nodes
% ids go from 0 to 368
% but MATLAB starts indices at 1 not 0

    end
end

% Abig is the adjacency matrix for the network.
% Note that Abig has an empty row and column for
% any station that is not part of the underground network.
% (That is, for any link that had transport line 12 or 13.)
% There are 98 of these rows: sum(sum(Abig)==0) = 98
% This is OK, as the Katz centrality for these nodes does not
% affect the others.

% Now look at usage data
% We only have usage data for the underground stations,
% these are 271 nodes

% 2017 2016 2015 2014 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008
%
% Usage.textdata is a 271Ã—2 cell array

% It is the station id for first row of Unum
